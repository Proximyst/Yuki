ゆき is a basic CS:GO 'cheat' written in https://rust-lang.org[Rust].
In its current state, it serves no more purpose than being a basic base for
further development.

== Development

To start developing, you only need to do the following:

. `git clone git@github.com:Proximyst/Yuki.git`
. `cd Yuki`
. Open a work environment and start working at it

It is highly encouraged that you link `pre-commit` to `.git/hooks/pre-commit`,
e.g. by using `New-Item -ItemType SymbolicLink -Path pre-commit -Target .git\hooks\pre-commit`
in an elevated PowerShell.
